# SIMULATION OF AUTOCORRELATION AND PSD USING SCILAB

# AIM:

Write a program for Autocorrelation and PSD of signals in SCILAB and verify Wiener-Khinchin relation.

# EQUIPMENTS Needed

• Computer with i3 Processor
• SCI LAB

# THEORY:

The Wiener-Khinchin theorem states that the power spectral density of a wide sense stationary random process is the Fourier transform of the corresponding autocorrelation function.

# Algorithm
1. Load or Define the Signal: Input your time-domain signal.

2. Compute Autocorrelation: Calculate the autocorrelation function of the signal.

3. Compute Power Spectral Density (PSD): Estimate the PSD of the signal, either directly using a method like Welch’s periodogram or by using the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation.

4. Plot Results: Visualize the autocorrelation function and PSD.

# PROCEDURE

• Refer Algorithms and write code for the experiment.

• Open SCILAB in System

• Type your code in New Editor

• Save the file

• Execute the code

• If any Error, correct it in code and execute again

• Verify the generated waveform using Tabulation and Model Waveform

# RESULT:
Thus the Autocorrelation and PSD are executed in Scilab and output is verified.
